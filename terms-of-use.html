            give you time to cancel payment of the next Fee if you are not happy with the change.</p>
        <p>4.2 The Fee for the ProMusicStreams™ Premium Plan is calculated to reflect the number of Artists you have included
            within
            your ProMusicStreams™ Premium Plan. You will be notified of and asked to confirm the additional Fee for each Artist
            when

            at any time from your ProMusicStreams Premium Plan.</p>

            and in
            doing so, you agree that we shall remove any Releases by additional Artists.</p>
        <p>4.4 You may terminate your Plan at any time within your account on the Site. We will refund the Fee paid for

            incurred or lost against any Royalties you may earn through your Plan.</p>

                of any
                sums to any third party, including any producer, writer or Artist</li>
            <li>you and/or the owner of the copyrights in the Releases, as the case may be, have not assigned your

        <p>6.7 If you breach any of the provisions of this Condition 6 or if we suspect any fraudulent activity on your
            account, in particular if you have provided to us false, fake or incorrect identification documents or

        </ol>
        <h2 id="7-royalties">7. Royalties</h2>
        <p>7.1 The calculation of your Royalties is set out in the description of your Plan. For the Monetization
            Service, an
            additional 15% revenue share is charged before your plan’s revenue share.</p>
        <p>7.2 Royalties are due only in respect of sums received from Music Platforms, Aggregators and through the
            Monetization Service. Music Platforms have the right to determine the fee due to download your Release and
            the
            providers of the Monetization Service determine how to monetize your Releases. Music Platforms, Aggregators
            and/or
            the providers of the Monetization Service may not pay any sums to us, and/or may require repayment of sums
            paid to
            us if they reasonably suspect fraudulent activity in respect of your Releases or your account generally,
            such as
            artificial streaming activity.</p>
        <p>7.3 You can see the Royalties earned under these Terms within your account on the Site. You can withdraw sums
            from
            the Royalties earned, and we shall pay these to the bank account you have provided to us. You are
            responsible for
            any bank fees due on such withdrawal. You cannot withdraw more funds than are available in your account and
            the
            minimum withdrawal is US$20 or the equivalent in any other currency.</p>
        <p>7.4 If cumulative withdrawals from your account reach £500, or such other sum as we may elect, or at any
            other time
            we determine, you must upload and submit identification documents as part of our regulatory requirements.
            Until
            these documents have been provided, the funds will be held in your account.</p>
        <p>7.5 You acknowledge that we are not a bank or other licensed financial institution and do not provide banking
            services or any financial services to you.</p>
        <p>7.6 You may not offset Royalties against Fees due to us.</p>
        <h2 id="8-disclaimer">8. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>8.1 We cannot control the activities of Music Platforms and the providers of the Monetization Service. We
            therefore

            accept
            your Release to their platform, or pay any sums to us. Accordingly, we do not warrant or represent that you
            will
            receive any Royalties, or any minimum level of Royalties.</p>
        <p>8.2 Subject to Condition 8.4, we shall in no circumstances be liable to you in contract, tort (including
            negligence)
            or otherwise for any:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>loss of profit, anticipated profits or business</li>
            <li>loss of data and content</li>
            <li>loss of opportunity</li>
            <li>loss of revenue or wasted expenditure</li>
            <li>loss of goodwill or reputation; and/or</li>
            <li>consequential, special or incidental loss or damage (whether or not advised of the possibility of the
                same)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The provisions of this Condition 8.2 are severable.</p>
        <p>8.3 Subject to Condition 8.4, our maximum liability to you whether in contract, tort or otherwise shall in no
            circumstances exceed the Royalties paid to you in the previous 6 months.</p>
        <p>8.4 Nothing in the Terms shall be construed as excluding or limiting our liability for death or personal
            injury
            caused by our negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or for any other liability that cannot
            be
            excluded by English law.</p>
        <p>8.5 Our Site may include third party advertisements, which may be targeted towards you. We do not endorse or
            recommend any product or service offered for sale by any advertiser within the advertisements on the Site

        <p>You shall defend and indemnify us and keep us indemnified and held harmless from and against any costs, fees,
