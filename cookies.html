        <h2 id="what-are-cookies">What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit our website.
            We, and some third-party service providers, use cookies on our website. Some are persistent cookies (cookies
            that remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time) and some are session ID cookies (cookies that
            expire when you close your browser).</p>
        <p>We may also use other tracking technologies like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking beacons” or “clear
            gifs”) and local storage. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to
            recognise when someone has visited our website, or opened an email that we have sent them.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about cookies at <a
                href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> and <a
                href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="how-we-use-cookies">How we use cookies.</h2>
        <p>Cookies help us to operate our website and provide services to you. In particular, they can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>enhance and customise your experience across our website</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>enable us to perform research and carry out analytics</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through our website,
            such as interactive content and analytics. These third-parties are responsible for the cookies they set on
            our website and we have no control over them</p>
        <h2 id="what-cookies-do-we-use">What cookies do we use?</h2>
        <p>In the tables below you can see a description of each cookie that we use and what it does.</p>
        <table style="color: white">

                    <td>Google Analytics</td>
                    <td>We also use Google Analytics to monitor how our websites and apps are used. Google Analytics
                        collects information anonymously and generates reports detailing information such as the number
                        of visits to the website, where visitors generally came from, how long they stayed on the
                        website and which pages they visited. Google Analytics places several persistent cookies on your
                        device’s hard drive. These do not collect any personal data. If you do not agree to this you can
                        disable persistent cookies in your browser. This will prevent Google Analytics from logging your
                        visits.</td>
