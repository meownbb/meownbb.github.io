            of the details have been included below. Further information can be found here</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Right of access: You have the right to obtain from us a copy of the personal data that we hold for
                    you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right to rectification: You can require us to correct errors in the personal data that we process for
                    you if it is
                    inaccurate, incomplete or out of date.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right to portability: You can request that we transfer your personal data to another service provider
                    if you initially
                    provided consent for us to use the personal data or where we used the personal data to perform a
                    contract with you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                    that we restrict
                    the processing of your personal information. If you believe our processing impacts on your
                    fundamental rights and
                    freedoms. However, we may demonstrate that we have legitimate grounds to process your personal data
                    not withstanding
                    your rights and freedoms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right to be forgotten: You also have the right at any time to require that we delete the personal
                    data that we hold
                    for you, where it is no longer necessary for us to hold it. However, whilst we respect your right to
                    be forgotten, we
                    may still retain your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and when we respond to your
                    request we shall
                    notify you of any specific legal reasons that we have to retain your personal data</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Right to stop receiving marketing information: You can ask us to stop sending you marketing
                    information, but please
                    note we shall continue to contact you in relation to any matters relating to your plan, if you have
                    one.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to charge an administrative fee if your request in relation to your rights is manifestly
            unfounded
            or excessive.</p>
        <p>If you have any complaints in relation to this Privacy Policy or otherwise in relation to our processing of
            your
            personal data, please tell us. We shall review and investigate your complaint and try to get back to you
